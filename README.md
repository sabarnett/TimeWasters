# A Time Wasters Compendium
I've never been one for games on computers. The sad fact is I have arthritis in my thumbs so the moders shoot-em-up games hold little interest for me. That said, there are alternatives that require some level os skill without super-human dexterity.

The purpose of this app is to get some practice in creating simple to play games. The kind of thing we used to play before computers became graphic processing work-horses.

At present, this Mac app contains three games;

* Minesweeper
* WordCraft
* Snake

Minesweeper and WordCraft were created by Paul Hudson in his Hacking With Swift live-streams. I have 'messed' with themto extend the games. Snake is mine.

More will be added at some point. This is just a starter project.
