The number on a cell shows the number of mines adjacent to it. Using this information, you can determine cells that are safe, and cells that contain mines. Cells suspected of being mines can be marked with a flag.",
                "To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine. There is no score, but there is a timer recording the time taken to finish the game. Difficulty can be increased by adding mines or starting with a larger grid. You can do this via the settings panel. Beginner level is usually on an 8x8 or 9x9 board containing 10 mines, Intermediate is usually on a 16x16 board with 40 mines and expert is usually on a 22x22 board with 99 mines; however, you are free to customise board size and mine count."

                "You can ndicate that you believe a cell to contain a mine by long-pressing on it. When you do this a warning symbol will be placed on the cell. There is no guarantee that the cell actually contains a mine, so beware! If you change your mind, long-press to remove the marker.",
