The number on a cell shows the number of mines adjacent to it. Using this information, you can determine cells that are safe, and cells that contain mines. Cells suspected of being mines can be marked with a flag.",

Difficulty can be increased by adding mines or starting with a larger grid. You can do this via the settings panel. Beginner level is usually on an 8x8 or 9x9 board containing 10 mines, Intermediate is usually on a 16x16 board with 40 mines and expert is usually on a 22x22 board with 99 mines; however, you are free to customize board size and mine count."
